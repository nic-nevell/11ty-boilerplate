## Previewing your content in the admin interface

Even though you added some new fields to your content types and you filled them in, they will not show up immediately in the preview pane. To get that working you must register aÂ [`previewTemplate`](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/customization/#registerpreviewtemplate). If you use any of the Netlify CMS starters the template is already created for you. All you need to do is retrieve the new data and update your rendered component(s) with this new data
